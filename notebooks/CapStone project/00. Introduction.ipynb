    "This capstone project will try to find a machine learning model to determine the travel time NYC taxi will have to handle per trip depending on the weather.\n",

    "This model should help organize the number of Taxi needed in town depending on the weather forecast.\n",

    "\n",
    "This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/nyc-taxi-trip-duration) has been found on Kaggle and was used in a competition where participants, based on individual trip attributes, should predict the duration of each trip in the test set. This dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this playground competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset covers data from the 1st of January until the 30th of June 2016.\n",

    "Most of the cleaning work have been done on this dataset, which is good news for me :-)\n",

    "## NYC Weeather informations\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend the previous dataset with weather informations, I've used the [Climate Data Search Engine](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/confirmation) from the *National Centers for Environmental Information*\n",
    "\n",
    "This search engine allows me to grab multiple weather informations concerning NYC covering the period of the NYC Taxi Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging those two datasets will let me build one with travel informations along with weather ones."
