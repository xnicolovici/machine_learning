    "# What to do\n",
    "Some Help: https://www.kaggle.com/philippecodes/open-food-facts-data-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Data import and high level exploration\n",
    "First, you will download the data and do some exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Download: Get the data from the Kaggle link provided and import it into Pandas. The dataset should include 356'027 samples and 163 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis: The goal at this stage is to get familiar with the data and create an overview of it using Python code. Keep in mind that the table has 163 columns which means that you will need to search for the interesting columns and focus on exploring them. There are many strategies to handle this part and several solutions will be accepted, but here are some ideas to help find interesting columns and explore their content:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the proportion of missing values per column/row? Should you keep, fill or remove these missing values? What would be the implications?\n",
    "* What are the different columns data types?\n",
    "* What are the mean/min/max/median values of numerical columns? Do you spot any issue from analyzing those statistics? ex. a negative amount of sugar, a maximum value extremely far from the 75% percentile (outlier?)\n",
    "* For numerical columns, how does the variable distribution look like? ex. using histograms or scatter/violin/density plots\n",
    "* Are there columns that contain lists? ex. lists of ingredients, tags\n",
    "* Are there columns that are very similar in their content?\n",
    "* Are columns with text always written using the same alphabet?\n",
    "* For categorical columns, what are the top 10 most frequent values?\n",
    "* Are there duplicate products?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right after, in task B, we will ask you to answer 3 research questions. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) questions from above will help you get a high-level understanding of the data set and help you find/design 3 research questions that you're interested in and that seem feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer those 3 research questions, you will very likely only need to analyze a subset of the 163 columns! Identify those columns and clean them as much as necessary to get reasonable results. But remember to stay pragmatic about your cleaning. If something influences the accuracy and reliability of your results, consider changing it. Otherwise, it is good to acknowledge, comment and move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Manipulating the data\n",
    "You will work with the data to investigate some properties of your choice. Your goal is to choose 3 interesting questions to answer about the data and perform the necessary steps for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions that you choose must be complex enough to allow for some substantial data manipulation. As a guideline here is a sample topic of analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic: Investigate the macronutrient breakdown across various foods (this is the percentage of calories that come from the 3 macronutrient groups: carbohydrates, protein and fats). What are the foods that have the highest ratios of each macronutrient? What are the foods that are most balanced? What is the macronutrient breakdown across different countries? Can you notice some trends or insights about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of your 3 questions choose appropriate visual methods to communicate your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Text data\n",
    "You will filter and group your data based on the ingredients_text column. Your goal is to find the five most common ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Time-series analysis\n",
    "You will investigate more closely the created_datetime and last_modified_datetime. First, you will analyze the mean time difference between these two values. And second, you will analyze the total number of items created each month over the full timeline of the data. For the second question, you will also choose an appropriate method to visualize your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Build a database\n",
    "You will build a database to hold your data. It is up to you to define appropriate tables as well as primary keys for connecting them. (The focus is definitely more on just using the basic methods/tools introduced in the course and not on building a complex database.) In particular, you can follow the following list of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "restrict your data to 1000 entries and 5 columns of your choice\n",
    "create a connection to a sqlite3 database\n",
    "create one or multiple tables, at least one of the tables should have a PRIMARY KEY\n",
    "fill the database with your data\n",
    "run at least one query to demonstrate that it works correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## F. Finding correlations\n",
    "You will try to find correlations between the different data fields. Your goal is to identify the variables which most affect the nutritional score and provide some insight into which factors cause both a low or a high nutritional score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the final Jupyter notebook you submit is very well documented.\n",
    "\n"
